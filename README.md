# python-starter

My personal python starter template. Intended for copy and paste use. 

This project is released into the public domain, so feel free to modify and use it as you wish.

## Usage

### Adjust package name

Copy these files into your personal project and replace all occurrences of ```packagename``` with your package name.

```bash
NEW_PROJECT_NAME=<YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME>
mv packagename $NEW_PROJECT_NAME
sed -i "s/packagename/$NEW_PROJECT_NAME/g" setup.py .coveragerc "${NEW_PROJECT_NAME}/__main__.py" tests/test_core.py 
```

### Adjust license

Replace the LICENSE file and change the ```license=Unlicense``` entry in ```setup.py``` to whatever you want to use. 
I would suggest the MIT license.

### Adjust author 

Also replace the author name in ```setup.py``` with your name.

### Adjust README.md

Adapt README.md, especially the installation instructions, according to your project. 

In particular, change the following entries:

- GitHub url
- Travis CI badge url
- codecov badge url
